It can be triggered by multiple etiologies, such as atopic dermatitis, diabetes, and chronic renal diseases. The mechanisms of CNPG are complicated and involved the interaction of the cutaneous, immune, and nervous systems. Diverse immune cells, including eosinophils, neutrophils, T cells, macrophages, and mast cells infiltrated the lesional skin of CNPG, which initiated the inflammatory cytokines and pruritogens release. In addition, the interaction between the immune cells and activated peripheral sensory nerve fibers by neurotransmitters caused neuroinflammation in the skin and intractable itch. This itch-scratch vicious cycle of CNPG results in disease exacerbation. CNPG is difficult to treat with traditional therapies.

Patients with PN suffer from an intractable itch-scratch cycle leading to impaired sleep, psychosocial distress and a significant disruption in quality of life. The pathogenesis of PN is associated with immune and neural dysregulation, mediated by inflammatory cytokines [such as interleukin (IL)-4, -13, -17, -22 and -31] and neuropeptides (such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide). There is a role for type 2 inflammation in PN in addition to T-helper (Th)17 and Th22-mediated inflammation. The neuroimmune feedback loop in PN involves neuropeptides released from nerve fibres that cause vasodilation and further recruitment of inflammatory cells. Inflammatory cells, particularly mast cells and eosinophils, degranulate and release neurotoxins, as well as nerve growth factor, which may contribute to the neuronal hyperplasia seen in the dermis of patients with PN and neural sensitization. Recent studies have also indicated underlying genetic susceptibility to PN in addition to environmental factors, the existence of various disease endotypes centred around degrees of type 2 inflammation or underlying myelopathy or spinal disc disease, and significant race and ethnicity-based differences, with African Americans having densely fibrotic skin lesions.

Kogoj performed experimental studies of allergic reactions in eczema and atopic dermatitis and introduced the term pruridermatitis (Pruridermatitis allergica chronica) into dermatological terminology instead of the name neurodermitis and other synonyms essentially describing atopic dermatitis (endogenous eczema, prurigo-asthma, prurigo Besnier). Academician Kogoj managed to define Mal de Meleda as a separate form of hereditary keratoderma and was engaged in the clinical symptomatology, serology, and therapy of syphilis, whereby he emphasized the so-called \"critical moment\" in the treatment of syphilis.

Underscoring relevant pathogenesis similarities emerging from AD, chronic idiopathic pruritus (CIP) and chronic prurigo (CP), several authors suggested the beneficial role of dupilumab in these conditions. The evidence on this subject is limited with no precise data available. In this study, we carried out a systematic literature review in order to evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab on both pruritus and skin manifestations in the two largest retrospective cohorts of patients with CP and CIP and tried to identify potential response predictors. Electronic searches were conducted on 4 databases. Our primary outcome was the improvement in pruritus measured by a reduction in the patient's reported numerical rating scale of itch (NRSI) by >4. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with a complete response at the end of treatment, reduction in the number of lesions by the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), improvement in numerical rating scale of sleep (NRSS), improvement in quality of life measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), time until patient perceived any improvement (Time-First) and time until the patient-reported absence of pruritus (Time-Final). Descriptive statistics were calculated for each demographic and clinical variable. Univariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the association between response to dupilumab and potential predictive factors. We included 25 articles in the analysis, counting a total of 153 patients. Based on CP patients' cohort (n\u2009=\u2009132), the mean NRSI at baseline was 8.79\u2009\u00b1\u20090.86 and the NRSI final was 2.32\u2009\u00b1\u20091.27. The mean time to first improvement was 5.18\u2009\u00b1\u20093.13\u2009weeks, while the time to complete improvement of pruritus (Time-final) was 13.6\u2009\u00b1\u200912.0\u2009weeks. Ninety patients out of 109 (83%) noticed an improvement in pruritus before 4\u2009weeks of dupilumab therapy. At the end of treatment, 18 patients out of 126 (14%) had a complete remission of pruritus and 110 patients out of 123 (89%) had a reduction of NRSI >4. The reduction in NRSI was significantly greater in patients improving before 4\u2009weeks of treatment (6.57\u2009\u00b1\u20091.71) compared with patients improving in more than 4\u2009weeks (5.49\u2009\u00b1\u20091.39, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Patients with history of AD and those who have been previously treated with cyclosporine or methotrexate had a significantly lower reduction in NRSI (e.g. 6.05\u2009\u00b1\u20091.34 vs. 7.08\u2009\u00b1\u20091.90, P\u2009<\u20090.01 for nonassociated AD patients). Based on CIP patient's cohort (n\u2009=\u200921), the mean NRSI at baseline was 8.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.80 and the NRSI final was 0.95\u2009\u00b1\u20090.59. The mean time to first improvement was 2\u2009\u00b1\u20090\u2009weeks, while the time to complete improvement (Time-final) was 14.6\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u2009weeks. At the end of treatment, 3 patients out of 21 (14%) had a complete remission of pruritus and 100% of patients had a reduction of NRSI >4. No serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported. The most common adverse event was mild conjunctivitis (13 cases). We highlight the importance of one early sign of improvement as a predictor of the future response to dupilumab: the improvement before 4\u2009weeks of treatment that leads significantly to a greater final reduction in NRSI.

In particular, PN was associated with substantial impact on multiple domains of QoL. No publication bias was detected. In conclusion, QoL is negatively impacted in PN. Future studies are necessary to determine the best instruments of measuring QoL in PN patients, better understand this association, and assess the impact in males and females separately.

Here, we present three cases of prurigo nodularis treated off-label with dupilumab, and a review of the existing literature. All patients in this study had longstanding severe disease and had tried multiple treatment modalities. They were treated with dupilumab at an initial dose of 600\u2009mg subcutaneously, followed by 300\u2009mg every 2\u2009weeks. Systematic literature searches were performed to identify literature describing the evaluation of the effect of treatment with dupilumab in prurigo nodularis. The physician's assessment of the patients revealed a good or excellent response to the treatment with dupilumab. Patients were evaluated after treatment for 4 and 7 months. Treatment was generally well-tolerated; one in three patients reported dry eyes. Four studies with a total of 11 patients (range: 1-4) were identified by the literature search. Complete response was noted in all 11 patients. Treatment with dupilumab appears to be safe and well-tolerated with clinical benefit in recalcitrant prurigo nodularis.

disease in which hard crusty lumps are formed on the skin that itches intensely. Repetitive rubbing, scratching, and touching results in more lesions in the skin. The itching is so intense that people scratch themselves to the point of bleeding or pain. The lumps formed in the skin are hard, and have about a half inch across, with a dry and rough top that is often scratched open. They tend to be located in the areas most easily reached and are worse on the outer sides: arms, shoulders and legs. The trunk, face and even palms can also be affected. The exact cause is unknown but some factors triggering PN include liver and kidneys problems, nervous and mental conditions and other skin diseases. Prurigo nodulares, in some cases, can be seen in other diseases such as lymphoma, chronic autoimmune cholestatic hepatitis, HIV infection, severe anemia,or a chronic kidney disease-related itching known as uremic pruritus. Treatment is very difficult, and may include corticoids, antihistaminic and other medication such as thalidomide and similar (Lenalidomide). In some cases, cryotherapy, photochemotherapy and habit reversal therapy for the itch-scratch cycle has improved the symptoms.

similarities with benign dermatoses such as atopic dermatitis (AD). Furthermore, the delineation from so-called \u201cparapsoriasis en plaque,\u201d a disease that can appear either in a small- or large-plaque form, is still controversial. Here, we characterize the parapsoriasis disease spectrum. Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of skin biopsies from patients within the parapsoriasis-to-early-stage MF spectrum, stratified for small and large plaques, and compared them to AD, psoriasis and healthy control skin. Results: 6 out of 8 large-plaque lesions harbored either an expanded alpha/beta or gamma/delta T-cell clone with downregulation of\u00a0CD7\u00a0expression, consistent with a diagnosis of early-stage MF. By contrast, 6 out of 7 small-plaque lesions were polyclonal in nature thereby lacking a lymphomatous phenotype, and also revealed a less inflammatory microenvironment than early-stage MF or AD. Of note, polyclonal small- and large-plaque lesions characteristically harbored a population of\u00a0NPY+\u00a0innate lymphoid cells and displayed a stromal signature of complement upregulation and antimicrobial hyperresponsiveness in fibroblasts and sweat gland cells, respectively. These conditions were clearly distinct from AD or psoriasis, which uniquely harbored CD3+CRTH2+ IL13-expressing \u201cTh2A\u201d cells or strong type 17 inflammation, respectively. Conclusion: These data position polyclonal small- and large-plaque dermatitis lesions as a separate disease entity, that characteristically harbors a so far undescribed ILC population. We thus propose the new term \u201cpolyclonal parapsoriasis en plaque\u201d to this kind of lesions, as they can be clearly differentiated from early and advanced-stage MF, psoriasis and AD on several

FBs in lesional PN were shifted towards a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-like phenotype, with POSTN+WNT5A+ CAFs increased in PN, and similarly so in squamous cell carcinoma. A multi-center cohort study revealed an increased risk of SCC and CAF-associated malignancies (breast and colorectal) in PN patients. Systemic fibroproliferative diseases (renal sclerosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) were upregulated in PN patients. Ligand receptor analyses demonstrated a fibroblast neuronal axis with FB-derived WNT5A and periostin interactions with neuronal receptors MCAM and ITGAV.

Furthermore, the delineation from so-called \u201cparapsoriasis en plaque,\u201d a disease that can appear either in a small- or large-plaque form, is still controversial. Here, we characterize the parapsoriasis disease spectrum. Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of skin biopsies from patients within the parapsoriasis-to-early-stage MF spectrum, stratified for small and large plaques, and compared them to AD, psoriasis and healthy control skin. Results: 6 out of 8 large-plaque lesions harbored either an expanded alpha/beta or gamma/delta T-cell clone with downregulation of\u00a0CD7\u00a0expression, consistent with a diagnosis of early-stage MF. By contrast, 6 out of 7 small-plaque lesions were polyclonal in nature thereby lacking a lymphomatous phenotype, and also revealed a less inflammatory microenvironment than early-stage MF or AD. Of note, polyclonal small- and large-plaque lesions characteristically harbored a population of\u00a0NPY+\u00a0innate lymphoid cells and displayed a stromal signature of complement upregulation and antimicrobial hyperresponsiveness in fibroblasts and sweat gland cells, respectively. These conditions were clearly distinct from AD or psoriasis, which uniquely harbored CD3+CRTH2+ IL13-expressing \u201cTh2A\u201d cells or strong type 17 inflammation, respectively. Conclusion: These data position polyclonal small- and large-plaque dermatitis lesions as a separate disease entity, that characteristically harbors a so far undescribed ILC population. We thus propose the new term \u201cpolyclonal parapsoriasis en plaque\u201d to this kind of lesions, as they can be clearly differentiated from early and advanced-stage MF, psoriasis and AD on several cellular and molecular levels.", "Title": ["Single-cell RNA sequencing defines disease-specific differences between chronic nodular prurigo and atopic dermatitis"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL24676": "Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["Comparison of skin cells obtained from PN, AD and HC donors.", "Raw data is not provided due to patient privacy concerns.", "Healthy Control samples 112 \u2013 HC1, 115 \u2013 HC2, 116 \u2013 HC3 and 121 \u2013 HC4 used in this manuscript are already publicly available via Gene Expression Omnibus GSE173205."], "PubMedIDs": ["37210042", "38565563", "39133553"], "PubMedURLs": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37210042/", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38565563/", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39133553/"], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM6932986", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "serum ige (kiu/l): 351", "diagnosis: Atopic Dermatitis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6932987", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "serum ige (kiu/l): 8", "diagnosis: Atopic Dermatitis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6932988", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "serum ige (kiu/l): 2045", "diagnosis: Atopic Dermatitis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6932989", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "serum ige (kiu/l): >5000", "diagnosis: Atopic Dermatitis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6932990", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "serum ige (kiu/l): >5000", "diagnosis: Atopic Dermatitis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6932991", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "serum ige (kiu/l): >5000", "diagnosis: Atopic Prurigo"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6932992", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "serum ige (kiu/l): 500", "diagnosis: Prurigo Nodularis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6932993", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "serum ige (kiu/l): 18", "diagnosis: Prurigo Nodularis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6932994", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "serum ige (kiu/l): 301", "diagnosis: Prurigo Nodularis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6932995", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "serum ige (kiu/l): 19", "diagnosis: Prurigo Nodularis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6932996", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "serum ige (kiu/l): 60", "diagnosis: Prurigo Nodularis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6932997", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "serum ige (kiu/l): 507", "diagnosis: Prurigo Nodularis"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM6932998", "TissueType": "Skin Biopsy", "Characteristics": ["tissue: Skin Biopsy", "serum ige (kiu/l): 2230", "diagnosis: Prurigo Nodularis"]}], "Organism": ["Human"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina NovaSeq 6000"], "StudyType": "scRNA"}]}, "/disease-profile/ontology/": {"data": []}}
